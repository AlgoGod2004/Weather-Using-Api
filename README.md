This project is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API. Users can enter a city name, and the app will display:

✅ Current Temperature (in Celsius)
✅ Wind Speed (in km/hr)
✅ Humidity Percentage
✅ City Name
✅ Weather Icon (Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy based on temperature)
